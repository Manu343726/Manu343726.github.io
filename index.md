I'm Manu SÃ¡nchez, and this is my personal website. I'm mostly a programmer, so the average stuff of this website will be programming related stuff. If you like it or not, I don't care,
I'm doing this just for fun.
Interesting, beautiful, crazy, bullshit stuff? Who knows, depends on you and your perspective. **Read and judge yourselves**.
