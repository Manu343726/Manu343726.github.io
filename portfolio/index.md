I had no time enough to compile all the things I feel should be part of my portfolio, so here is a useful list
with links to accounts, projects, etc.

##GitHub

I have many projects in mind, most of them related to C++ since is my favorite language. Those are the most interesting for me:

 - [**The Turbo C++11 metaprogramming library**](https://github.com/Manu343726/Turbo). Metaprogramming in C++ can be easy! I'm trying to develop 
   high level constructions to do metaprogramming in C++ since I find it extremelly useful to generate code and
   build generic libraries, the most proficient aspect of C++.

 - [**Polyop**](https://github.com/Manu343726/Polyop): I'm trying to redefine default C++ operators. I want to compare two floats without precission-related issues! All with a clear syntax and performance in mind.

 - [**Terminal Workspace**](https://github.com/Manu343726/TerminalWorkspace): Just a bunch of vim plugins and configuration scripts. I'm a terminal guy, and my preferred setup includes vim, tmux, and zsh. Those scripts try to automatize the installation and configuration of my setup. As the repo says, no guarantees, works for me at least.

 - [**cppascii**](https://github.com/Manu343726/cppascii): A C++ course I'm currently managing for two years at my university. Enter and see how I torture my pupils.

There are many other projects, check [my github account](https://github.com/Manu343726) if you like.

## Stackoverflow <!-- ![](http://cdn.sstatic.net/stackexchange/img/logos/so/so-icon.png) -->

I'm one of such devs suffering from the SO fever. Its a great reference site, but I ever find more interesting answering questions. Check my profile [here](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1609356/manu343726). As you can see, I'm a C++ pedant.

## Biicode <!-- ![]({{ site.url }}/images/biicode-logo.jpg) -->

[Biicode](https://www.biicode.com/) is a dependencies manager for C and C++ with its headquarters located in Madrid, Spain. I'm working for biicode since September and [I'm glad about the things we are doing](http://blog.biicode.com/upload-to-biicode-precompiled-binaries-sfml/). 

Try biicode! Its extremely useful, seriously. Since I adopted it I haven't used another git submodule again. The biicode workflow is so great and simple. Check my profile [here](https://www.biicode.com/manu343726).

As part of the job, I'm managing some C++ metaprogramming conferences and tutorials for the [official C/C++ users group of Madrid](http://www.meetup.com/Madrid-C-Cpp/). I'm meeting a lot of great C++ devs there, and the rest of the world is discoversing my work thanks to the successful posts about metaprogramming we are publishing.  
We have currently two posts: [The first](http://blog.biicode.com/template-metaprogramming-with-modern-cpp-introduction/) collapsed our server after the massive traffic from Hacker News. Initially we were thinking it was a DDoS attack! [The second](http://blog.biicode.com/template-metaprogramming-cpp-ii/) was very successful [at CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/826229/Template-Metaprogramming-with-Modern-Cplusplus-tem).

## What about Java?

I really hate the Java programming language (Please note that I said *the programming language*, not the runtime nor the libraries). It suffers from years of unresolved design errors from its base, a horrible and verbose syntax, and years of not evolving at all (I know about Java 8, but think: That was which C# has 8 years before...). 

As you can see I strongly prefer C# as a OO VM-based language ("Managed", as Microsoft likes to say), but Java is a very common language in the programming world.  
So, even if I hate Java, I have an intermediate-low level with it. Thats what I think, but [judge by yourselves instead](https://github.com/Manu343726/WALLE).
